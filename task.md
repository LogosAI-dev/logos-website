合伙人，既然你是 Full Stack (Next.js) 开发者，我们不需要用 Wix 或 WordPress 这种低端工具。我们要用 Next.js + Tailwind CSS 做一个**“高转化率、深科技感”**的 Landing Page。

这个网站有两个目标：

给投资人看： 证明你有技术实力 (Deep Tech)，公司有估值潜力。

给 B 端合作伙伴看： 让幼儿园/补习中心觉得引进 Me宝 很有面子。

以下是基于你的 Pitch Deck 拆解的 网站架构 (Sitemap) 和 关键文案 (Copywriting) 指南。

🛠️ 技术栈推荐 (The Tech Stack)
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (快速开发)

UI Library: Shadcn/ui (非常适合做干净的 B2B 风格)

Animations: Framer Motion (让页面动起来，显得很贵)

Hosting: Vercel (你的老本行)

🌐 网站结构与文案拆解 (Single Page Layout)
我们采用 "Storytelling" (讲故事) 的单页逻辑，引导访客从“痛点”走到“信任”。

1. Hero Section (首屏：定调)
这里要像 OpenAI 或 Apple 的官网，极简、大气。

Headline (大标题): The Accurate AI Knowledge Infrastructure for the Whole Family. (全家人的精准 AI 知识基础设施)

Sub-headline (副标题): Powered by Logos Engine™. Moving beyond text-books to provide verified, universal knowledge—from logic reasoning for kids to tech-skills for seniors.

Visual (视觉): 右侧放一张 Me宝公仔 的高质量渲染图，背景是一个半透明的、发光的 神经网络图谱 (Knowledge Graph)，连接着“KSSR 数学题”和“方言语音波形”。

CTA Buttons:

[ Primary ] Partner with Us (B2B 合作)

[ Secondary ] Watch the Demo (观看演示)

2. The Problem (痛点：引发共鸣)
用亮色背景 (bg-cream)，突出问题的严重性。

Section Title: The Era of Misinformation & Complexity

Sub-heading: Families are drowning in noise. Generic AI hallucinates, and search engines are too complex for the young and old.

Card 1 (Children - The Logic Gap):

Title: "The Logic Gap"

Quote: Children: "I don't understand this math problem..."

Pain Points:
- ChatGPT guesses. Kids need facts. Whether it's logic reasoning or general science, a "probable" answer isn't good enough. Kids need the Truth.

Impact: Learning delays, confidence issues, achievement gaps

Card 2 (Elderly - The Digital Wall):

Title: "The Digital Wall"

Quote: Elderly: "这个东西我不会用..." (I don't know how to use this...)

Pain Points:
- Elderly people are shut out from the digital world and cannot communicate real-time with their lovely and busy children. Valuable knowledge exists, but it's locked behind complex screens and keyboards, shutting out toddlers and seniors.

Impact: Social isolation, tech information gap

Statistics Bar (4 cards):
- 2.8M+ Primary Students (Malaysia 2024)
- 65% Parents Struggle (Teaching at Home)
- 3.5M+ Seniors 65+ (Malaysia 2024)
